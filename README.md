# electron-super-simple-updater

A super simple local updater for Electron, just with replacing app.asar

## What's this?

This is an updater for Electron apps, working just by replacing `app.asar` locally. It doesn't require specific version scheme or remote server or any OS specific packages such as `.dmg` or whatever. Just place a JSON file for update information and `update.asar` in `resources`, and that's it.

If your app is something very serious, it is recommended using [`autoUpdater`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/auto-updater.md).
